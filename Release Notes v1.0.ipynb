    "+ first player is randomly assigned\n",
    "+ player vs player game mode (required)\n",
    "+ player vs AI game mode (optional +20 points)\n",
    "+ displays updated gameboard between turns\n",
    "+ placement is based on pre-assigned positional numbers (1-9)\n",
    "+ checks for winner and prints when winner exists \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will provide a walkthrough of the steps taken as we build our game. This first release of our game only has one gamemode - player vs player. Future releases will include a Random AI opponent as well as a Genius AI opponent providing users with three game mode options from which to choose. Additionally, this program is designed to be played via the Command Line Interface. Future releases may include a GUI instead. "
