## CS 506: Programming for Computing

### Independent Project (IP) Instructions

Each student is required to write a Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) program using object-oriented programming approach.

The student is going to build the classic game tic-tac-toe in Python. In this game, one player is X by a user and the other player is O. You can imagine that the game will be played by two individuals. The person who will start should be assigned randomly provided the program prior to start. If the student chooses to use an AI-based algorithm to simulate the other player, extra 20 points will be given. Each run, the program should display the board (3x3) as shown below. Placement is made based on the pre-assigned positional number. Your program should check if there is a winner and print the winner if found then exits.

One other requirement is to store the move of each X and O to be saved in a file called tictactoe.txt (X:5 O:2 X:1 O:9 etc...).
