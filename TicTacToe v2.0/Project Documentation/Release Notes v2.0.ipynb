    "\n",
    "In summary, in our initial release, we designed a game with the following features:  \n",
    "+ creates and displays an updateable gameboard\n",
    "+ players choose their marker (X or O)\n",
    "+ first player is randomly assigned\n",
    "+ accepts player inputs of 1-9 to determine moves based on open squares\n",
    "+ prevents invalid inputs from interrupting gameplay progress\n",
    "+ swaps players after each player turn\n",
    "+ checks for wins or draws after each player turn\n",
    "+ main gameplay loop designed for PvP mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The following provides a brief outline of how our initial Tic Tac Toe program was updated to create version 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features Added:**\n",
    "+ all match moves and outcomes are recorded in [tic_tac_toe.txt](/TicTacToe%20v2.0/tic_tac_toe.txt)\n",
    "+ startup and game over menu displays and options\n",
    "+ accepts user inputs for menu options\n",
    "+ captures and executes **Ctrl + c** (**KeyInterrupt**) even during user input events\n",
    "+ second PvE game mode available versus a randomized AI\n",
    "+ checks for moves available throughout match \n",
    "+ determines random AI moves from available moves\n",
    "+ ability to reset gameboard after a winner or draw has been determined\n",
    "+ replay option available at the end of each match\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules Added:**\n",
    "+ *main.py*: \n",
    "    + **startup( ):**  loads entire program \n",
    "    + **game_over( ):**  provides user options when replay option is declined at the end of a match\n",
    "+ *ttt_menus.py* --> **class TTTMenus:**\n",
    "    + **create_welcome_screen( ):**  gives game a main menu\n",
    "    + **display_welcome_screen( ):**  displays the main menu upon startup\n",
    "    + **create_game_over_screen( ):**  gives game a game over menu\n",
    "    + **display_game_over_screen( ):**  displays menu when replay option is declined at the end of a match\n",
    "    + **get_player_selection( ):**  captures player menu selections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods Added to TicTacToe:**\n",
    "+ **game_mode_2_PvE( ):**  player vs randomized AI\n",
    "+ **reset_board( ):**  needed to enable replay\n",
    "+ **replay( ):**  enables replay option at the end of a match\n",
    "+ **computer_move( ):**  records AI movements\n",
    "+ **random_moves( ):**  provides AI opponent its gameplay logic\n",
    "+ **human_moves( ):**  capture human player input --> pulled from former **get_coords( )** method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods Modified within TicTacToe:**\n",
    "+ **__init__( ):**  added values list and text file \n",
    "+ **is_board_full( ):**  changed **item** to **square** for consistency \n",
    "+ **assign_markers( ):**  removed **self** declaration from **player** and **opponent** variables\n",
    "+ **get_coords( ):**  input is no longer hardcoded; **value** changed to **move** for consistency \n",
    "+ **player_won( ):**  became **is_winner( )**; round bracket use was made consistent throughout the method\n",
    "+ **play_game_1( ):**  became **game_mode_1_PvP( )** -- currently not functional, needs to be updated\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this release includes a Test Case module for our project in order to automate tests when building future releases. The rest of this notebook will provide further details on the updated portions of our program, including new explanatory comments within our game's code. Future releases may include a Genius AI mode that uses the minimax algorithm to drive the computers game logic, a GUI version of the game, and exectuable programs for easy play testing by the public.
